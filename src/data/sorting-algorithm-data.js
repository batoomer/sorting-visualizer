        `Bubble sort is a basic sorting method that repeatedly goes through the list, comparing adjacent items and switching them if 
        they are not in the correct order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are required, indicating the list is sorted. 
        The name "bubble sort" comes from the way smaller or larger elements "rise" to the top of the list.`,
        `Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it less efficient for larger lists. However, it is easy to understand 
        and implement, making it a popular choice for beginners learning about sorting algorithms. Despite its inefficiency, 
        bubble sort can be useful in certain cases where the list is small or the data is already partially sorted.`,
        `Bubble sort is not the only sorting algorithm that uses the "compare and swap" approach. There are other algorithms like Insertion 
        sort and Selection sort which also use this approach but have different ways of selecting the element to compare and swap.`

    description: [
        `Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and places 
        it at the beginning of the sorted portion of the list. This process is repeated until all elements have been moved to the sorted portion of 
        the list. Selection sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.`,

        `However, it has its own advantages over other sorting algorithms like it's easy to understand and implement, it's in-place sorting algorithm,
        which means it doesn't require any additional memory space. It's also useful in certain cases where the data is already partially sorted.`
